## üåü Welcome to the "Connecting the Dots" Challenge

What if every time you opened a PDF, it didn't just sit there‚Äîit spoke to you, connected ideas, and narrated meaning across your entire library?

That's the future we're building ‚Äî and we want you to help shape it.

In the Connecting the Dots Challenge, our mission is to reimagine the humble PDF as an intelligent, interactive experience‚Äîone that understands structure, surfaces insights, and responds like a trusted research companion.

## üöÄ The Journey

**Round 1:**
Kick things off by building the brains ‚Äî extract structured outlines from raw PDFs with blazing speed and pinpoint accuracy. Then, power it up with on-device intelligence that understands sections and links related ideas together.

**Round 2:**
It's showtime! Build a beautiful, intuitive reading webapp using Adobe's PDF Embed API. You will be using your Round 1 work to design a futuristic webapp.

## üí° Why This Matters

In a world flooded with documents, what wins is not more content ‚Äî it's context. We're not just building tools ‚Äî we're building the future of how we read, learn, and connect. No matter your background ‚Äî ML hacker, UI builder, or insight whisperer ‚Äî this is your stage.

# Our Challenge Solutions

## üìã Challenge 1a: PDF Document Structure Extractor

<div align="center">
<img src="./assets/workflow.svg" width="700" alt="PDF Processing Workflow">
</div>

A high-performance, containerized solution for extracting structured data from PDF documents.

### Key Features

- **Offline Processing**: Works without internet access
- **High Performance**: Processes 50-page PDFs in under 10 seconds
- **Multilingual Support**: Extracts structure from PDFs in various languages
- **Containerized**: Runs in an isolated Docker environment
- **Resource Efficient**: Low memory footprint (< 200MB)

### Extraction Approach

- **Title Extraction**: Analyzes first page, identifies largest font size text
- **Heading Extraction**: Classifies headings into H1, H2, H3 based on font properties

### Output Format

```json
{
  "title": "Document Title",
  "outline": [
    { "level": "H1", "text": "Introduction", "page": 1 },
    { "level": "H2", "text": "What is AI?", "page": 2 },
    { "level": "H3", "text": "History of AI", "page": 3 },
    { "level": "H2", "text": "Applications", "page": 4 }
  ]
}
```

<img src="./assets/architecture_diagram.svg" alt="System Architecture" width="700" style="margin-top: 20px;">
</div>

An advanced PDF analysis solution that processes multiple document collections and extracts relevant content based on specific personas and use cases.

### Key Features

- **Persona-based Content Analysis**: Tailors content extraction to specific user roles
- **Importance Ranking**: Automatically ranks extracted sections by relevance
- **Multi-collection Processing**: Handles multiple document collections efficiently
- **Subsection Analysis**: Provides detailed analysis of the most relevant subsections
- **Optimized Performance**: Processes document collections in under 60 seconds

### Technical Approach

1. **Document Processing**: Extract text while preserving structure
2. **Section Identification**: Identify sections using heuristic approaches
3. **Semantic Matching**: Match sections with persona and job requirements
4. **Ranking**: Rank sections based on relevance to user needs
5. **Subsection Analysis**: Extract specific subsections addressing job requirements

</div>

### Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel Processing**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent document processing
- **Embedding Caching**: Caches embeddings to avoid redundant computation
- **Early Filtering**: Filters out irrelevant content early in the pipeline
