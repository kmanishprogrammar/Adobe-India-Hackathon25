# Technical Approach Explanation

## Overview

This document explains the technical approach used in the Persona-Driven Document Intelligence system. The system extracts and prioritizes relevant sections from a collection of documents based on a specific persona and their job-to-be-done.

## Key Components

### 1. Document Processing

We use `pdfplumber` to extract text from PDF documents. This library provides robust text extraction capabilities and preserves the structure of the document, including page numbers and text positioning.

```python
def extract_text_from_pdf(self, pdf_path):
    sections = []
    all_text = ""
    
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        # Process each page
        for page_num, page in enumerate(pdf.pages, 1):
            text = page.extract_text()
            # Further processing...
```

### 2. Section Identification

We use a heuristic approach to identify sections within each document. The heuristic looks for lines that are likely to be section headers based on their formatting and content:

- Short lines (less than 100 characters)
- Lines that don't end with a period
- Lines with 10 or fewer words
- Lines with at least one capitalized word

```python
# Simple heuristic for section headers
if (len(stripped_line) < 100 and 
    not stripped_line.endswith('.') and
    len(stripped_line.split()) <= 10 and
    any(word[0].isupper() for word in stripped_line.split() if word)):
    
    # Save previous section if it has content
    if current_section["text"].strip():
        sections.append(current_section)
    
    # Start new section
    current_section = {"title": stripped_line, "text": "", "page": page_num}
```

### 3. Semantic Matching

We use the `sentence-transformers` library with the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model to create embeddings for sections and match them with the persona and job requirements. This model is lightweight (less than 100MB) but provides good performance for semantic similarity tasks.

```python
# Create a query based on persona and job focus
query = f"{persona['role']} with expertise in {persona['expertise']} needs to {job_focus['task']} "
query += f"focusing on {', '.join(job_focus['focus'])}"

# Get embeddings for the query and all sections
query_embedding = self.model.encode([query])[0]
section_embedding = self.model.encode([section_text])[0]

# Calculate similarity score
similarity = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], [section_embedding])[0][0]
```

### 4. Ranking

We rank sections based on their cosine similarity score with the query. The query is constructed from the persona and job-to-be-done information.

```python
# Sort by similarity score in descending order
ranked_sections.sort(key=lambda x: x["score"], reverse=True)
```

### 5. Subsection Analysis

For the most relevant sections, we further analyze the content to extract specific subsections that address the job requirements. We split the section text into paragraphs and rank them based on their relevance to the persona and job-to-be-done.

```python
# Split text into paragraphs
paragraphs = re.split(r'\n\s*\n', section_text)

# Filter out very short paragraphs
paragraphs = [p for p in paragraphs if len(p.split()) > 10]

# Calculate similarity scores
similarities = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], paragraph_embeddings)[0]

# Create subsection analysis
subsections = []
for i, (paragraph, similarity) in enumerate(zip(paragraphs, similarities)):
    if similarity > 0.3:  # Only include relevant paragraphs
        subsections.append({
            "refined_text": paragraph,
            "relevance_score": float(similarity)
        })
```

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Model Selection

We use the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from the `sentence-transformers` library. This model is:
- Small (less than 100MB)
- Fast (can process thousands of sentences per second on CPU)
- Accurate (achieves good performance on semantic similarity tasks)

### 2. Batch Processing

We process embeddings in batches to improve performance:

```python
# Get embeddings for all paragraphs at once
paragraph_embeddings = self.model.encode(paragraphs)
```

### 3. Early Filtering

We filter out very short paragraphs before processing to reduce the number of embeddings that need to be computed:

```python
# Filter out very short paragraphs
paragraphs = [p for p in paragraphs if len(p.split()) > 10]
```

### 4. Relevance Threshold

We only include paragraphs with a similarity score above a certain threshold (0.3) to ensure that only relevant content is included in the output:

```python
if similarity > 0.3:  # Only include relevant paragraphs
    subsections.append({
        "refined_text": paragraph,
        "relevance_score": float(similarity)
    })
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. PDF Structure Variation

**Challenge**: Different PDFs have different structures, making it difficult to identify sections consistently.

**Solution**: We use a heuristic approach that looks for common patterns in section headers, such as short lines with capitalized words that don't end with a period.

### 2. Semantic Matching Accuracy

**Challenge**: Matching sections with the persona and job requirements requires understanding the semantic meaning of the text.

**Solution**: We use a pre-trained sentence transformer model that has been fine-tuned on semantic similarity tasks.

### 3. Performance Constraints

**Challenge**: The system needs to process multiple documents within 60 seconds on CPU only.

**Solution**: We use a lightweight model and optimize the processing pipeline to minimize computation time.

## Future Improvements

1. **Better Section Identification**: Use machine learning to identify section headers more accurately.
2. **Document Structure Analysis**: Incorporate document structure analysis to better understand the hierarchy of sections.
3. **Multi-modal Analysis**: Include analysis of images, tables, and other non-text elements in the documents.
4. **Personalization**: Fine-tune the model on domain-specific data to improve matching accuracy for specific personas and jobs.
5. **Caching**: Implement caching of embeddings to improve performance when processing similar documents.
